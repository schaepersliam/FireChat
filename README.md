# FireChat

## Intro
FireChat is a chat app for iOS built with Swift and Google's Firebase services.
It features a login-, register- and chat screen as well as a home screen.

## How to use it
To start the app clone the project with XCode and open the .xcodeworkspace file.
Not the .xcodeproject file, this will only cause you errors with the installed pods.

Then, just run the app on either an emulator or a physical iOS device.

Here is a sample account if you don't want to create one:
+ Email: 123@test.com
+ Password: 123456

**Note**: If you choose to use an emulator make sure you'll use the software keyboard
provided by the emulator. If you try to use the emulator on this app with a physical keyboard
you'll probably get an awkward symbol when typing the @ symbol.
